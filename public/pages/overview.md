# üìñ Overview

## Summary

I'm a problem-solver who enjoys new challenges and pays great attention to detail. After discovering my passion for software development, I decided to enroll in one of the highest-rated coding bootcamps in the world, Coding Dojo and learned 3 full technology stacks: Python, MEAN, Java.
